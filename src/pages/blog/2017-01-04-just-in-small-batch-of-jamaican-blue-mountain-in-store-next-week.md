### ***WHAT IS NEEDED FOR PERFECT COOLING?***

Many in-built features of a laptop help in dissipating heat and keeping the laptop cooler. The laptops that are made specifically for gaming have these cooling apparatuses. When you are buying a gaming laptop, you need to make sure that it has the right **cooling apparatus**.

1- Heat Sink

The **heats sink** a conductor that takes the heat away from the CPU to the fin. Since the fins have a large surface area, heat can dissipate quickly and easily through the computer. As a result of this, the Processor stays cool even if you have been using it for a long time.

2- Cooling Fans

Also, gaming laptops have **cooling fans**. These fans have two functions. First of all, they draw the cooler air from the exterior of the laptop into it. Secondly, they exhaust the hot air from the interior of the laptop to the outside. Due to this, the laptop stays cool as long as the fans are in perfect working condition.

3- Metal Chassis

Some gaming laptops also come with a **metal chassis**, which is used as the passive source of heat dissipation through the system. Since metals, such as copper, are good conductors, they allow efficient heat dissipation through the laptop.

**With the combination of the heat sink and cooling fans, you can ensure that the processor and graphics card are cooled down effectively. The laptop needs to stay cool to offer the best performance.**

### **THINGS TO CONSIDER BEFORE BUYING A GAMING LAPTOP**

When you have to buy the best cooling gaming laptop, there are a few things that you need to look for. By keeping these factors in consideration, you can select a good gaping laptop for yourself.

**1- Keypad Quality**\
Since you have to use your keyboard a lot when you are playing games, the keyboard must be of good quality. The keyboard should allow you to **travel** from one key to another easily. Also, it is best if there are **backlit keys** on the keyboard as they will illuminate the keys when you press them. The Asus laptops mentioned in our guide have backlit keypads.

**2- Cooling Apparatus**\
If you want to have a **[budget gaming laptop](https://mytravelgadget.com/best-laptops-for-roblox/) with the best cooling system**, you should make sure that it has appropriate cooling apparatus. For example, the HP Omen laptop on our list has a **3-sided venting system**. Since there are more vents, heat dissipation is quicker. It also has **multiple-way airflow**. When air can flow in multiple directions, it can be exhausted out of the laptop quickly.

The coolest gaming laptop would have more fans and an **effective heat sink**. You can also opt for laptops with a **metal build**. A computer with metal chassis can easily be the **coolest running gaming laptop** as metal allows conduction and releases heat quickly from the system.

**3- Storage**\
Games take up a lot of space, so a gaming laptop must have sufficient room. Go for a computer that at least has **1TB of storage** as it will let you install many games.

**4- Display**\
The display matters a lot since it deals with an essential part of gaming: the viewing experience. Nowadays, **there are laptops with a 4k display**, which is quite impressive. However, these laptops also cost more, so you should keep that in mind.

**5- GPU**\
